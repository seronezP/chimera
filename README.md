### HOW TO LAUNCH

___

To run the launcher, first you need to make sure that you have Python version 3.13 installed, then you need to install the dependencies:

`pip3 install customtkinter minecraft-launcher-lib `

Next you can download this repository and open in any IDE. 
  
Lastly, select your Minecraft version, enter your nickname and click “Launch”.

If you need to change default folder or set theme, open "settings".

If you don't enter any custom minecraft folder path, miecraft will be installed in default folder.

Default minecraft folders: on MacOs this folder is `users/user/library/Application Support/minecraft`, on windows `users/user/appdata/roaming/minecraft`.
